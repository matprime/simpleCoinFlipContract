This Ethereum Solidity smart contract allows you to flip virtual coins and bet agains smart contract
based on 50% of randomness for every flip.

In game you bet against contract and if case if you win,
will contract send you reward in Ethereum to your wallet address.

Package of files in repository also include html, js and css files 
for simple front end to gambling with contract.

Base for code in repository is from Ivan on Tech Academy and "Smart Contract Programming" course.
Have plans to additionally modify code in repository and will first change random generator for flips in Solidity contract.


The easiest way to get this contract working is to use Superblocks Lab
https://lab.superblocks.com/

If you will be using Superblocks Lab make sure that you will use some Ethereum Network, instead virtual Network generated inside browser's window. Smart contract will not work inside Superblocks virtual network generated inside browser's window. You can use Rinekebry test Ethereum network or any other to get this contract working. 

To gamble with smart contract you will need also needd to have Metamask web wallet and some Ethereum inside.
