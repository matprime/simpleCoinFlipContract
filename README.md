based on 50% of randomness for every flip. 

Package of files in repository also include html, js and css files 
for simple front end to gambling with contract.

The easiest way to get this contract working is to use Superblocks Lab

Base for code in repository is from Ivan on Tech Academy and "Smart Contract Programming" course.
Have plans to additionally modify code in repository and will first change random generator for flips in Solidity contract.
