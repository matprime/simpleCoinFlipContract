This Ethereum Solidity smart contract allows you to flip virtual coins and bet agains smart contract
based on 50% of randomness for every flip. 

Package of files in repository also include html, js and css files 
for simple front end to gambling with contract.

The easiest way to get this contract working is to use Superblocks Lab
https://lab.superblocks.com/

Base for code is from Ivan on Tech Academy and "Smart Contract Programming" course.
I Have plans to additionally modify it, and will first change random generator for flips in Solidity contract.
